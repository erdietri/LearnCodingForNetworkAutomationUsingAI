## Practice Exercises

Before starting the exercises...
* Confirm that VS Code is installed. Can you open the application?
* Confirm that Python is installed. Does running python3 --version give you a version of Python or an error?

1. In VS Code, pull up the terminal and list the files in the current directory.
2. Magnify the application view 3x. Everything should appear 3x larger.
3. Copy and paste the following code into the code editor:
   '''print("I'm learning how to code weeeeeeeeeeeee.")'''
4. Save the file.
5. Run the file using the play button, and view the output in the terminal. Do you see the print statement?
6. In the search bar, go to Show and Run Commands, then find the command for creating a new terminal.

# 1.0 Logic & Programmatic Thinking

In this module, you'll learn what it takes to learn to code, dispel some common misconceptions, and learn to start embodying a programmatic (logical) mindset.

## Instructional Video 

![How To *Think* Like A Developer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe9f05ed-ce65-4374-b49a-39eeedf09316)

Let's get exposed to logic and a developer's mindset in this < 13-minute [video](https://youtu.be/Tx22UM1BB80).

## Practice Exercises

With most topics in this course, getting the practice exercises correct and understanding why they are correct is absolutely essential. **Because this video was simply exposure to using logic, I ask that you simply give these questions a try.** You should be able to answer questions #1-2. Some of you will also be able to answer #3-4. The last question is a challenge question, but it's great to get your gears turning - so if that one's a little tough, simply write down your current thoughts about it and we'll revisit it later.

**According to the video...**
1. Coding is a skill like _______. It takes time and practice to both learn and improve.
2. Explain what kind of math skills are required to learn to code.
3. What's the difference between a set and a list? (Also, just a heads up there will be more differences later.)
4. Let's pretend you're standing at your front door and want to get to your refrigerator. Draw a graph that includes nodes (Living in a small place? Draw a graph of the routes you could take to another destination of your choice, or make it networking-related. For instance, what paths can you take from outside of your office building to a certain patch panel?)
5. CHALLENGE: Let's pretend you want to diagnose the cause of port flapping in a big group of syslog messages. Let's also pretend that you need to group these syslog messages logically so that your algorithm can diagnose the problem. Do you think this group of syslog messages should be a set or a list? Explain your reasoning.

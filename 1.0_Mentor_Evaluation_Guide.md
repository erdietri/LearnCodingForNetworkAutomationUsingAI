This evaluation session will be a little different than others. The point of this lesson was not to necessarily learn the logic concepts, but to start thinking more logically.

For this reason, I recommend having a discussion around questions 3-5. If the student could only answer question 3, focus there. If the student easily answered question 3, or even question 4, focus your time discussing question 5.

This should be a gentle, open-ended discussion around why the student came up with the answer they did.

Make sure that this conversation remains positive and the words "no, you're wrong" or similar are not spoken. If the student seems highly misguided on a concept, simply let them know the correction without telling them they're wrong and ask "what if" questions to get them down a new line of thought.

Regardless of the answers given for questions #3-5, for this topic only, it is okay for the student to proceed to the next video/lesson. 

We will return to these concepts in a later video, where answering the questions correctly will become more critical.

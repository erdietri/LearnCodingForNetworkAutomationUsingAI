# Learn Coding For Network Automation Using AI
This repository is a course that takes network engineers step-by-step through writing Python code for network automation with...get this...AI! (Yes, AI can be used not just for cheating, but as a teaching resource. Here is the full [Cisco Live talk](https://www.ciscolive.com/on-demand/on-demand-library.html?search=Erika%20Dietrick#/session/1740098448290001dyuq) for reference.) 

AI is transforming our world and how we code; rather than deem it all good or all bad, we have used this as an opportunity to fix what is a largely broken developer curriculum. Specifically, we have taken the time to do the following: 
* Determined what foundational coding topics network engineers **actually** need to know to get started.
* Provided a roadmap of these topics that has been subdivided based on when various features of AI should be introduced.
* Created custom, 15-min-or-less educational videos for prerequisite topics
* Designed practical and reasonable exercises to apply learning
* Provided an assessment guide for mentors/leaders to have practical conversations around learning modules

## Audience
* Attendees of DEVNET-2720 Teaching Coding Skills in the Age of AI
* The global network engineering community
